			<h2>[About Me]</h2>
			<p class="adjust">
				I grew up in a small town in rural West Virigina called Madison. Coming from the country, I've always stood out -- instead of being one of the
				kids who wanted to go study medicine, or go into the mines, I was the one who built his own computers, learn how to make basic websites, read
				up on how computers actually worked. Technology has always fasinated me, and as time goes on it continues to amaze me. As an aspiring Software
				Engineer I want to be one of the leaders forging a new path for innovation, discovery, and advancement in Technology
